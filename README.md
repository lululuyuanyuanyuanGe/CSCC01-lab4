# CSCC01 Lab 4 &mdash; MERN & Chatter
In this lab, you will be building a full-stack social media web application similar to ~~Twitter~~ X. Our app will be called Chatter. You will expand your knowledge of React, Express, and Sequelize.

In this lab, you will:
- Learn how to perform user authentication and create sessions in the backend.
- Get practice with working in React and passing data to components.
- Work with the different React _hooks_.
- Work with a SQL-based ORM (Sequelize) and a sqlite database.
- Learn about CORS.

## Logistics

- This lab is worth 9 points and 2.5% of your final grade.
- The lab will be supervised by your TA during the tutorial session of Week 5. 
- If you encounter any problem while doing the steps listed in the next section, ask the TA for help.
- Attendance will be taken during the tutorial session, and a **10%** penalty will be applied for being absent with no valid excuse.
- The lab should be done individually.
- The due date is **February 8th, 2025 at 11:59PM**

## Lab Setup
Firstly, clone the GitHub repository onto your local machine through GitHub classroom.

At the root of the repository, you will notice two folders:
- `backend`: The backend application code (**Express**)
- `frontend`: The frontend website code (**React**)

Before proceeding, `cd` into both of these directories and install all the required Node packages by running
```
npm install
```

## Backend
The backend makes use of the [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/) ORM in conjunction with a sqlite database to store our data.

The API takes in inputs and returns data in **JSON** format.

### File Structure
The backend API makes use of an MVC architecture and is organized in the following format:
- `controllers/`: The controllers of the application.
- `models/`: Database models using Sequelize.
- `routes/`: The routes for the API.
- `database.js`: The code that initializes our database connection.
- `server.js`: The entry-point to the application.

### Starting the Backend
1. `cd backend`
2. `npm install`
3. Start the application with `npm start`.

### Testing the Endpoints
---
The API runs on port `8080` by default and has a base URL of `http://localhost`, so if you want to test any of the endpoints you are implementing, you can:
1. Find the *path* of the endpoint by looking in `server.js` for the desired router, then subsequently in `routes/` in the router file.
2. Concatenate this to `http://localhost:8080` and call the API using the full URL, the correct HTTP method, any required headers, and a `body` (if applicable).

For example, to register a new user, make a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8080/api/users/register`.

**NOTE:** In all subsequent tasks, ensure that the correct[ HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) are being returned by the API. You can follow the guide in that link, but if you're unsure which one should be returned in any case, feel free to ask a TA during your tutorial.

If any request is ever missing any body parameters, the API should return `400` with the following response:

```javascript
{
  error: "Missing parameters in the request body"
}
```

### Error Handling
---
Simple error handling has been implemented for you already in the controllers so your application should (in most cases) never crash. When an error is thrown in the backend in your implemented routes, the API returns `500` and its response has the form:

```javascript
{
  error: "<generic error message>"
}
```

When this happens, the error information is also logged to your console for debugging.

### About Sequelize
---
Here are some common sequelize queries that will help you with this lab:

Suppose we have this model defined for us (we do):

```javascript
const User = sequelize.define('user', {
  username: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
  hash: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
});
```

Note that Sequelize automatically adds an **auto-incremented** integer attribute called `id` as the primary key if none is specified.

To create a new user entry:

```javascript
const user = await User.create({
  username: "<username>",
  hash: "<hash>"
}); // Returns the created user instance
const userId = user.id; // Can check the assigned ID
```

To get a user by a field `username`:

```javascript
const user = await User.findOne({
  where: {
    username: "<username>"
  }
}); // Retrieves the user with username "<username>" -- null if no such user
```

Alternatively, if you know the field you want to search for is the primary key of the table, you can do this instead:

```javascript
const user = await User.findByPk(2); // Retrieves the user with id 2 -- null if no such user.
```

### Task 1: User Registration

---

We want users to be able to register to our application using a username and password. Of course, we don't want to store the password in clear in our database, so we will make use of [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) in order to generate _salted hashes_ to store instead.

A `user` model has been defined for you under `models/user.js` and looks something like this:

```javascript
const User = sequelize.define('user', {
  username: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
  hash: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
});
```

**Task:** Implement the `register` function in `usersController.js` to properly register a new user to the application, storing their information in the sqlite database given `username` and `password` in the request body.

If another user already has the same username in the database, the API should return `400` and the response should be:

```javascript
{
  error: "The username is already taken."
}
```

Upon successful registration, the API should return `201` and the response should be:

```javascript
{
  message: "The user has been successfully registered"
}
```

### Task 2: User Authentication
---
We want users to be able to login to our application. After they have logged in, we want our backend to remember this through a session. A session is a server-side storage of user data that persists across multiple requests, allowing the server to remember the user between interactions given a session ID stored in a cookie.

We can use a middleware called [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) which implements this type of stateful authentication for us.

Note that the default behaviour of `express-session` is to store the user's information in memory so the sessions are lost when the express application is restarted (this is ok for the lab).

We can enable the `express-session` middleware by placing this in our `server.js` file:

```javascript
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET_KEY,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
  })
);
```

Don't forget to create a `.env` file in `backend/` and define `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` in it for this to work. The TA will grade your lab using their own key so there's no need to commit the `.env` file.

Once we've enabled this middleware, we can read and write to the session like so:

```javascript
req.session.userId = 1;
const userId = req.session.userId; // 1
```

`express-session` will generate a cookie and send it back to the client using a `Set-Cookie` header once you have modified the session automatically. In all subsequent requests, if **credentials** are enabled (more on that later on), the client will also automatically send this cookie to the server for you.

**Task:** Implement the `login` function in `usersController.js` to log the user into the application given `username` and `password` in the request body. The API should store the user's user ID in `req.session.userId` and username `req.session.username` in the session upon succesful login.

If either the username or password is incorrect, return `401` and the following response: 

```javascript
{
  error: "The username/password is incorrect"
}
```

Upon successful login, the API should return `201` (to indicate the creation of a session) and the following response:

```javascript
{
  message: "Logged in successfully"
}
```

### Task 2.1: User Information
---
In some cases, it's useful to have an endpoint that returns the information of the current user given their session ID. This endpoint will be useful later on when the frontend wants to check if the current user has a valid unexpired session.

**Task:** Implement the `me` function in `controllers/usersController.js` to return the username and user ID of the user making the request. We can get this information from `req.session`.

If no session for the user exists, the API should return `401` and the response should be:

```javascript
{
  error: "User not authenticated"
}
```

Otherwise, if the session exists, the API should return `200` and the response should be:

```javascript
{
  id: 1 // The user's ID
  username: "<The user's username>"
}
```

### Task 3: Creating Posts ###
---
Now we get into the actual posts on our website. We're only going to implement post creation for this simple lab.

A post object has the following properties, which you can see in the `models` folder:

```javascript
const Post = sequelize.define('post', {
  content: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
  authorId: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: DataTypes.DATE,
    allowNull: false,
  },
  likes: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    defaultValue: 0,
  },
  dislikes: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    defaultValue: 0,
  },
});
```

**Task:** Implement the `createPost` function in `controllers/postsController.js` to create a post and insert it into the database given the post `content` in the body.

Only requests with a valid session may create posts. If a session doesn't exist, then the API should return `401` and the response should be:

```javascript
{
  error: "User not authenticated"
}
```

New posts should have 0 likes, 0 dislikes, `createdAt` should be the current date and time, and `authorId` should be set to the current user's ID stored in the session.

## Frontend

### File Structure
The frontend React application has the following file structure (notable files listed only):
- `public`: Static website files.
- `src/`: Our React application source folder.
- `src/components/`: The folder containing our React components.
- `src/App.css`: The styles for our application.
- `src/config.js`: Configuration settings (the API URL is in here).
- `src/App.js`: The React code that is displayed on the homepage of the application.

### Starting the Frontend
1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. Start the application with `npm start`.

### Task 4: Registration Form ###
---
The registration form component has been nearly completed for you in `src/components/register.js`. All that's left for you to do is to implement the functionality for calling the API given the user's data.

**Task:** Implement the `register` function in `src/components/register.js` to call the backend API with the user's `username` and `password` in the request body. Provide adequate visual feedback to the user using the `statusMessage` state variable.

### Task 4.1: CORS
---
You'll notice that the requests you make to the backend server are failing because of CORS. Our frontend hosted at `http://localhost:3000/` is considered a different origin than our backend hosted at `http://localhost:8080/`, which is causing the issues. You can read more on what CORS is and how it protects you [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

To fix this problem, we have to make use of the [CORS middleware package](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) to add the relevant CORS headers to all endpoints.

**Task:** Configure CORS correctly in the Express backend in `server.js` so that the browser does not block our requests to the server.

Your configuration should look similar to this (with "???" filled out correctly):

```javascript
const corsConfig = {
  origin: '???',
  credentials: true
};
app.use(cors(corsConfig));
```

### Task 5: Login Form ###
---
The login form component has been nearly completed for you in `src/components/login.js`. All that's left for you to do is to implement the functionality for calling the API given the user's data.

**Task:** Implement the `login` function in `src/components/register.js` to call the backend API with the user's `username` and `password` in the request body. Provide adequate visual feedback to the user using the `statusMessage` state variable.

Ensure that the user is redirected to the home page upon successful login.

### About Credentials
---
**Important:** When making your request to the backend using the `fetch` API, make sure to put `credentials: 'include'` in your request options for `express-session` to work.

```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${apiURL}/users/login`, {
  method: 'POST',
  ...
  credentials: 'include',
  ...
});
```

You must do this for any endpoint that requires the use of `express-session`; otherwise, cookies will not be sent or set in the browser.

### Task 6: Fetching User Information ###
---
When the page initially loads, we want to check if the user is logged in or not. If the user is logged in already, we will show the create post form, and the logout button; otherwise, we will hide the create post form, and show the login and register buttons.

This logic has already been implemented for you, and all you have to do is set the `loggedIn` state variable in `src/App.js` to `true` or `false` depending on whether or not the user is logged in.

**Task:** Implement the `me` function in `src/App.js` to call the backend API to check if the user is logged in or not; set the `loggedIn` state variable accordingly. This function should also set the `user` state variable with some important user information (username and/or id).

**HINT:** Use the endpoint implemented in **Task 2.1**.


### Task 7: Creating Posts ###
---
The post creation form component is mostly done, and again, all that's left is to implement the logic. If you don't see the create POST form on the page, login first.

**Task:** Implement the `createPost` function in `src/components/createPost.js` to call the backend API with the user's post `content` in the request body to create a new post. Once a user successfully creates a post, the list of posts should be refreshed.
